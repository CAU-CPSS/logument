## Implementation of **_LOGUMENT_**

### Structure

- **Version _[]uint64_**: An array of versions that _LOGUMENT_ manages; should be continuos
- **Snapshot _map[uint64]tson.Tson_**: A map which contains an initial Snapshot (by `Create`) and Snapshots from `Snapshot` Function {version: Snapshot}
- **Patches _map[uint64]tsonpatch.Patch_**: A map of Patches managed internally in _LOGUMENT_ {version: Patches}
- **PatchPool _tsonpatch.Patch_**: Patches to be managed in _LOGUMENT_

### Primitive operations

- **Create(_snapshot tson.Tson, patches tsonpatch.Patch_)**: Make a new _LOGUMENT_ using an initial snapshot (**_Note_**: The function name in the implementation is `NewLogument`)

- **Store(_patches tsonpatch.Patch_)**: Store new patches in the PatchPool temporarily; These patches are queued and will be later integrated into the _LOGUMENT_ state via the `Append` operation

- **Append()**: Incorporate all pending patches from the PatchPool into the Patches, update(increase) the version, and clear the PatchPool

  > ðŸ’¡ Implementation detail
  >
  > Append, as defined in the _LOGUMENT_ paper, is implemented by sequentially executing `Store` and `Append`.

- **Track(_vi, vj uint64_)**: Extract patches that have changed _Values_ between the vi and the vj, preparing them for transmission

- **Snapshot(_vk uint64_)**: Generate a snapshot representing the _LOGUMENT_ state at the specified version by applying the corresponding patches to the nearest previous snapshot

- **Slice(_vi, vj uint64_)**: Extract a subset of the _LOGUMENT_ that includes all snapshots and patches between the version vi and vj (inclusive)

### Supporting operations

- **Set(_vk uint64, op tsonpatch.OpType, path string, value any_)**: Update the state with a JSON-supported _value_, and create the patch of which _op_ is either `add` or `replace`

- **Unset(_vk uint64, op tsonpatch.OpType, path string_)**: Remove the specific path, and create the patch that _op_ is `remove`

- **TestSet(_vk uint64, op tsonpatch.OpType, path string, value any_)**: `Set` only if _value_ has changed

- **TestUnset(_vk uint64, op tsonpatch.OpType, path string_)**: `Unset` only if _path_ has removed

- **TemporalTrack(_tsi, tsj int64_)**: Extract patches between the tsi and the tsj, enabling to query the evolution and history of data over time

- **TemporalSnapshot(_tsk int64_)**: Create a snapshot based on a target timestamp

- **TemporalSlice(_tsi, tsj int64_)**: Extract a subset of the _LOGUMENT_ document based on the specified start and end timestamps

### Additional supporting operation

- **Compact(_path string_)**: For the specified targetPath, remove patches where only the timestamp has changed (i.e., retain only those patches where the _Value_ has actually been modified)

- **History(_path string_)**: Retrieve the history of changes at the specified target path; This includes all patches that have modified the value at the target path

## About **_TSON_**

**_TSON_**, which stands for _Time-Stamped_ JSON, is used to store timestamps as well as data values.

### BNF of **_TSON_**

```ebnf
<tson> ::= <object> | <array> | <value>

<object> ::= "{" <members>? "}"
<members> ::= <pair> ("," <pair>)*
<pair> ::= <string> <timestamp>? ":" <value>

<array> ::= "[" <elements>? "]"
<elements> ::= <value> ("," <value>)*

<value> ::= <primitive> <timestamp>? | <object> | <array> | "null"
<primitive> ::= <string> | <number> | <boolean>

<timestamp> ::= "<" <timestamp_value> ">"
```

### VSCode Extension

There is a Visual Studio Code extension, which enables **_TSON_** syntax highlighting.  
Please refer to [VSCode-TSON-Extension](https://github.com/CAU-CPSS/VSCode-TSON-Extension) repository, and [**_TSON_** extension on VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rollingress.tson)

## Usage

### _**LOGUMENT**_ Demo

```bash
go run main.go
```

Then navigate to `localhost:8080` to interact.

### _**TSON**_ & _**TSON Patch**_ Generation with VSS dataset

```bash
go run main.go [ARGUMENTS...]
```

**Parameters:**

- `cars <int>`: \[required\] the number of cars
- `files <int>`: \[required\] the number of files per each car
- `change_rate <float64>`: Change rate for each file
- `size <float64>`: Dataset size ratio (0.5: Use 50% attributes of VSS)
- `dataset <string>`: Path to VSS JSON dataset
